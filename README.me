#Stardew Valley Tracker

This is a scheduling to keep track and optimize your day in Stardew Valley. 
Ex:


#How to run
Go version 1.10.4

>make
>bin/stardewvalley-track

It will prompt you for the current season and day in your Stardew Valley game, 
then tell you if any birthdays, festivals, or other notable events are happening that day. 
You can keep going forward a day at a time as you play the game.
